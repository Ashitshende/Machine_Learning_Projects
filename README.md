## Project 1: Data Analysis of Automobile Dataset and Price Prediction using Random Forest Regression
The "Data Analysis of Automobile Dataset and Price Prediction using Random Forest Regression.ipynb" file is one of the machine learning projects in this repository.It analyzes a dataset of Automobile characteristics and builds a model to accurately predict Automobile prices. The project involves Importing data into Pandas dataframe from website, Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA), Feature Engineering, Data Preprocessing,Building Random Forest Regression Model,training on Train set and Hyperparameter Tunning with GridSearchCv to find best performing model. Final model performed well on Test set with Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE) of 5.64% . The goal of this project is to create a robust pricing model that can assist car buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.

## Project 2: Comparative Analysis of Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network Models for Automobile Price Prediction
The "Comparative Analysis of Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network Models for Automobile Price Prediction.ipynb" file is another Machine Learning Projects in this Repository.It aims to develop a Machine Learning model to accurately predict the prices of Automobile. Multiple techniques, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Artificial Neural Networks used to build the models,GridSearchCV is used for hyperparameter tuning in the decision tree and random forest models, ensuring optimal parameter settings. In the artificial neural network model, hyperparameter tuning is performed manually to obtain the best-performing model. This Models are evaluated and compared based on their performance on a test set.  The objective is to achieve a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of less than 5%. The Best Performing model is the Decision Tree(MAPE=o.153), which exhibits the best performance after hyperparameter tuning.
