## Project 1: Data Analysis of Automobile Dataset and Price Prediction using Random Forest Regression
The "Data Analysis of Automobile Dataset and Price Prediction using Random Forest Regression.ipynb" file is one of the machine learning projects in this repository.It analyzes a dataset of Automobile characteristics and builds a model to accurately predict Automobile prices. The project involves Importing data into Pandas dataframe from website, Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA), Feature Engineering, Data Preprocessing,Building Random Forest Regression Model,training on Train set and Hyperparameter Tunning with GridSearchCv to find best performing model. Final model performed well on Test set with Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE) of 5.64% . The goal of this project is to create a robust pricing model that can assist car buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.dataset link-"https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DA0101EN/auto.csv"
